# Surf_Analysis
Deliverable 3: 
For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.
The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis to determine whether the surf and ice cream shop business, Surf N’ Shake Shop, would be sustainable year round. For that W. Ivy had requested more detailed information about the temperature such as the data for the months of June and December in Oahu.

Results: 
The results will look at the annual temperature data for the months of June and December.

Results for the month of June:
- Average temperature: 74.94 °F
- Minimum temperature: 64 °F
- Maximum temperature: 85 °F
Total data: 1700

Results for the month of December:
- Average temperature: 71.04 °F
- Minimum temperature: 56 °F
- Maximum temperature: 83 °F
Total data: 1517

Summary: 
The results show that opening the surf and ice cream shop is a good investment and can be successful. As shown in the results the average temperature is warm for most months in the year. That means the warm temperature will attract tourist to visit Oahu year almost around and they can shop at the surf shop. Even though the data analysis on the precipitation indicates that there are days with heavy rainfall, there are still most days with good weather most days around the year.
